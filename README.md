# Environment Switcher

I was tired of having to launch make commands in different routes everytime I had to work on a different project.
So I decided to make a script to automatize this process.

## How it works

You just have to write your projects name as a key and the route as a value inside projects.py.

``` python
    projects = {
    "x" : os.path.expanduser("~/your_project/route/"),
    "y" : os.path.expanduser("~/your_project/route/"),
}
```

Then you open the script route in your terminal and execute it by running: **python3 main.py**
